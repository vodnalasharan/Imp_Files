Email Etiquette:
==================
-> For Professionalism
-> For Efficiency of message

To-> receiver
CC-> Mentions email id's who should know what is going between sender and receiver
BCC Speciality-> We can include more emails like capacityy is more
-> We cannot see other recipients like we can see in cc.

Subject-> Simple description -> No rule to keep how many words but 7-8 is good as per company norms.
Subject gives us info like giving attention to a mail or not or can take some time and open it later.
Don't use ambiguous words like subject line: Last Month Report. 
Here we don't know which month and what report.
Major rules for email:
=======================
1)Short
2)Describe what's in email
3)Avoid Ambiguity

Body:
Salutation-> Dear or Hi, Use prefix like Mr/Ms depending on position of them.
Upto 3 members we can use names like Hi Sharan,Adhvy and Vodnala
For 4 or above we can use All, Team, Etc..

Greeting is optional in emails.

Pleasantries -> Mentioning what you are 
Ex: I am Sharan - Cognizant Employee from Chennai.
Usage:
======= 
1)when it is rare or 
2)contacting very first time

Body:
1) Use Multiple Paragraphs
2) Use Bullet points for imp points
3) Use Table for imp info

Parallelism:
=============
It is the repetition of grammatical elements in writing and 
speaking, which influences both the grammatical structure and the meaning of thoughts presented.
->Same part of speech

It's optional but do it when it is possible
Ex:
====
Start the session
Open the presentation
Present the topics

Way to present the body paras:
================================
1) Most imp ones-> actual purpose
2) Supporting Details-> add anything to purpose
3) General info-> Good to send to recipient.

After Body we will mention Signature
Structure:
===========
Name
Designation
Contact
Company logo
Client logo depending on the project

Tips:
=======
->Punctuations
->Use Abbrevations which are accepted in corporate world.
->No Contractions-> I'm, I don't,........
->Use exclamations very rarely and only one, Ex: Good Morning!
->Hitting reply all means spamming others mailboxes.. because it may not relevant to all.
->Proof read: to know whether we are sending correct and accurate info. 
->Add email atlast-> 
->Attaching docs-> If there are more docs merge or push them in one doc and send.
=>Provide warning before sending large attachments because in outlook, sender and recipient emails will be blocked when sender sends 
the mail and didn't receive by recipient so that recipient can't send any mails in transit time of receiving mail.
->Uppercase usage should be limited like use only when to grab the attention.
->Avoid humor and sarcasm.

Readability Factor:
========================
How they perceive...
1) Result Oriented-> Direct to the point.
2) Process Oriented-> Explain everything.
3) People Oriented-> (TONE)=>Keep in my mind how they are receiving or how you are conveying it.
4) Idea Oriented-> Mention all the keypoints like giving titles of the situation, no need to elaborate(Short and Crispy)



Chat Etiquette::
===================
1) Opening: Greeting, intro, purpose.
2) Probing(which means questioning): Phrase questions clearly, use open and close ended questions
=> Open ended means only one word or yes/no or anything which is not brief, close is opposite to open ended.
3) Acknowledgements: Empathy(To tell the sender that we understood it clearly), Canned responses(Non-human responses like chatbot responding)(if applicable)
4) Closing: Summary(Imp keypoints of the discussion), Confirmation(confirmation for the action plan)


Effective Communication::
==========================
1) Clarity: Explaining technical concepts in understandable terms
2) Conciseness: Delivering info without unnecessary complexity or length
3) Active Listening: Understanding the needs, concerns, and questions of others
