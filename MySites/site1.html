            <h3>Harry Porter</h3>
            <p>Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author 
                J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends,
                Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
                The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, 
                overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).</p>

            <h3>Avengers:Endgame</h3>
            <p>The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War Part 2, but Marvel Studios later
                removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely
                signing on to write the script a month later. It is a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story 
                arcs of several main characters. The film's plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from 
                throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional 
                filming took place in the Metro and downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England.</p>

            <h3>Titanic</h3>
            <p>RMS Titanic was a British ocean liner that sank in the early hours of 15 April 1912 as a result of
                striking an iceberg on her maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City, United States. 
                It was the second time White Star Line had lost a ship on its maiden voyage, the first being RMS
                Tayleur in 1854. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, approximately 1,500 died (figures vary), making the incident 
                one of the deadliest peacetime sinkings of a single ship.[4] Titanic, operated by White Star Line, carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as 
                hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia,
                and elsewhere in Europe who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada. </p>
